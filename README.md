<p><em>
Welcome! My name is SÃ©rgio and I'm a Test Automation Engineer.
</em></p>
<br>

#### Here are some facts about me:

- <i><b>I don't simply report issues</b></i> ðŸ™… <i><b>I drive quality from the outset.</b></i>
I am passionate about quality, and I believe that my role starts well before development. Quality is the responsibility of the whole team, and it is my role to support everyone on the team to understand and live this.

- <i><b>I take pride in my automation because it helps my team go faster</b></i> ðŸ’¨
I write my automation code with the same care, skill, and craft as the best production code.

- <i><b>I believe that automation should serve the whole team and not just the tester</b></i> ðŸ’¯
I leverage automation not only to speed up my own testing, but to help developers deliver higher quality products faster, and to help business articulate their needs more precisely.
